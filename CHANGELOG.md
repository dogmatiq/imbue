### Fixed

- Fixed rendering of code locations in error messages under Go v1.21
- Removed use of `golang.org/x/exp` package. This package is not versioned and
  as such breaking changes can cause conflicts with other dependencies

## [0.7.0] - 2023-04-05

Despite the presence of breaking changes due to modified function signatures,
this release does not alter the usage of the API under normal circumstances.

### Added

- Added `Catalog` which is a collection of dependency declarations that can be reused by multiple container instances
- Added `ContainerAware` interface, which is implemented by `Container` and `Catalog`

### Changed

- **[BC]** `WithX()`, `WithXNamed()`, `WithXGrouped()` and `DecorateX()` now accept `ContainerAware` instead of `*Container`

## [0.6.2] - 2022-08-24

### Added

- Add `Container.WaitGroup()` and the `GoX()` functions

### Fixed

- Fix data race in `Context.Defer()`

## [0.6.0] - 2022-08-03

### Changed

- **[BC]** `Context` is now an interface instead of a struct

## Removed

- **[BC]** Remove all environment variable related features

## [0.5.1] - 2022-07-03

### Fixed

- `DecorateX()` now panics when called for a type that has already been constructed
- `Container.Close()` now gives file/line information about deferred functions that return an error
- Functions deferred by `Context.Defer()` are now called immediately if the constructor (or a decorator) fails

## [0.5.0] - 2022-06-29

### Added

- Add `ByName.Name()` method, which returns the dependency name as a string
- Add `FromGroup.Group()` method, which returns the group name as a string

- Add `Optional[T]` for representing optional dependencies

### Changed

- **[BC]** Changed `ByName.Value` from a field to a method
- **[BC]** Changed `FromGroup.Value` from a field to a method

## [0.3.0] - 2022-06-19
